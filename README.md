# OpenProfileViewer

If you're broke, just build it yourself. I don't have an extra $5 lying around, so I'm remaking [this cool plugin](https://builtbybit.com/resources/profileviewer-player-stats-in-discord.21911/) from scratch and adding in some additional features.

I'll be updating this README before the initial release with more information about the plugin.
